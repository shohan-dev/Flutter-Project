# Flutter Animations Guide 🌟

Flutter offers a rich set of animation capabilities to enhance the user experience. Here is a comprehensive list of animation types in Flutter:

## Topics 📚

1. **Implicit Animations**
2. **Explicit Animations**
3. **Hero Animations**
4. **Physics-based Animations**
5. **Flare Animations**
6. **Animation Controllers**
7. **Custom Animations**

### Implicit Animations 🌀
Implicit animations are simple to use and require minimal code. They are used for straightforward animations where the start and end values are known.

**Examples:**
- `AnimatedContainer`
- `AnimatedOpacity`
- `AnimatedAlign`

### Explicit Animations 🎨
Explicit animations give you more control over the animation process. They require the use of `AnimationController` and `Tween`.

**Examples:**
- `AnimatedBuilder`
- `Transition`

### Hero Animations ✨
Hero animations are used for shared element transitions between different screens. This animation type creates a seamless transition effect for elements that appear on two screens.

### Physics-based Animations ⚙️
Physics-based animations mimic real-world physics to create natural movement.

**Examples:**
- `SpringSimulation`
- `GravitySimulation`
- `FrictionSimulation`

### Flare Animations 🌐
Flare animations are vector-based animations that can be integrated into your Flutter application. They are created using the Flare design tool and provide complex, high-performance animations.

### Animation Controllers 🎛️
Animation controllers are the core of explicit animations in Flutter. They manage the animation's state and control the duration, playback, and status of the animation.

### Custom Animations 🎢
Custom animations are animations that you create from scratch, combining the flexibility of Flutter's animation framework with your unique animation requirements.
